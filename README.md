This is number wizard; a simple way to learn C# as a new language paired with game design, and commits I'm making with plenty of comments for new C# users to understand.
The simple program uses the UNITY ENGINE terminal to guess your number between 1 and 1000 based on keyboard input.

This particular program is tied with the UNITY ENGINE which will be pushed to my github shortly. Note that it will be printing to the console using that MonoBehavior

The main take aways from this repo is to look at how functions are built, how to make new variables, take in a users input, and organize your code effectively with C#.

Please keep checking for updates as I'll be adding UI to this program and doing further C# projects as I continue my education on the topic and complete online challenges/projects.
Personal UNITY ENGINE projects and original ideas will also be posted through my repos.
If you're a JavaScript user please poke around my repos as well as I have older projects and new Phaser (game development) projects using JS coming as well.

Thanks and happy C#ing!
